                    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
                    <P>We deployed the dataset from the U.S. Department of Education.
                        From the data source we found, we researched the relationship
                        between multiple educational areas and SAT scores.</P>
                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <P>For three million first-time freshman students in the US every year, choosing their dream college
                        from offers is always a challenging problem. According to the College Scorecard Data provided
                        by the U.S. Department of Education, there are 6418 colleges in America that can be divided
                        into three main types: Private for-profit, Private nonprofit and Public.<br>
                        From this data, we can see that colleges are everywhere in America, which makes choosing
                        one especially hard. Although every student all prefer to go to a college with a good reputation
                        like Harvard or UCB, the fact is that the rate of acceptance is only 5.4% and 16.9% in 2019 for
                        these two colleges. By this, students have to prove they are qualified for some good colleges
                        using their SAT, ACT score, GPA, and their family fortune.<br>
                        In order to help these applicants make their choice of college wisely, a successful guide
                        generated from all college data would help them a lot in the application and save their time in
                        finding every college.<br>
                        Above all, we decided to generate a successful application guide from analyzing the College
                        Scorecard. We will analyze the relationship between students’ SAT score , College’s completion
                        rate, College’s type, College’s student’s size, and College’s average salary for its graduate
                        students and give students some advice for their application.<br>
                    </P>

                        <div class="col-md-6">
                            <p> From the scatterplot, it is clear that colleges are scattered everywhere
                                in the United States, which makes choosing one especially hard. </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Although every
                            student prefers to going to a college that is highly reputable such as Harvard and UCB,
                            the rate of acceptance is as low as 5.4% and 16.9% in 2019 for these two colleges. Therefore,
                            students have to prove that they are qualified for those good colleges using their SAT, ACT score,
                            GPA, and their family fortune. In order to help these applicants make their choice of college wisely,
                            a successful guide generated from all college data would help them a lot in the application as well
                            as save their time in finding every college.</p>

                    <h2>Research Goals</h2>

                <h2> Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    This project focuses on the relationship between students’ SAT scores at admission and their
                    subsequent probability of completion within 150% of the expected completion time. These probability
                    are further broken down by the school types, degree types, and school sizes by undergraduate
                    enrollment, respectively. It is observed that as students’ SAT score increases, their chances of
                    completion also increases linearly. Higher SAT score students tend to attend private nonprofit,
                    predominantly bachelor’s degree granting universities regardless of school size, while lower score
                    students prefer private nonprofit, small size, predominantly bachelor’s degree granting universities.
                    These choices would maximize their completion rate within 150% of their expected graduation.
                    However, this analysis is conducted on a rather small sample size of around 1200, because only these
                    many data regarding SAT scores were provided. Also, most of the schools that provided their scores
                    are predominantly bachelor’s degree granting. This might be due to that other degrees granting
                    schools do not require the SAT score, such as some associate’s degree granting schools and
                    graduate’s degree granting schools. Moreover, there might be many other confounding factors
                    regarding students’ completion rate, such as amount of student loan, cost of tuition, whether a
                    student had transferred, etc. From such a small sample size, this analysis is only a suggested
                    indicative summary of the kind of institution that a student most likely will attend based on their
                    SAT scores to maximize their completion rate.
