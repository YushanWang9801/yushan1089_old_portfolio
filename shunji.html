                        On January 17th, 2020, a film named Last Letter was released in Japan. The movie was directed by
                        one of my favorite directors, Shinji Iwai. The story of the movie is the drama of a cross-century
                        romance, and this new release reminds me of Shinji Iwai’s first letter. It is a cinematic creation
                        across the whole century. About a century ago, Marcel Proust, one of the most reputable French
                        novelist, wrote a novel, named A la recherche du temps perdu (Remembrance Of Things Past) and
                        this author emerged a grand significance to Shinji Iwai over a half century later, which is the
                        remarkable movie creation, Love Letter. Love Letter was directed by Shinji Iwai in 1995 and was
                        recognized as one of the director’s best creations. Moreover, the movie Love Letter is the first
                        letter of Shinji Iwai’s creation. Love Letter is deemed to be classic for its romance genre, due
                        to the filming techniques of how it unveils the precious memories that were long lost and neglected
                        in the past, as well as how it relieves obsession about the love that was never meant to be. In
                        a subtle and gentle way, the movie slowly unfolds stories of the past and the present, like one
                        slowly peels an apple until the skin eventually falls off and reveals the flesh.
                    </p>

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The audience might be completely confused by the beginning of the movie.
                        The narration of stories of the two main female characters, Hiroko Watanabe and Itsuki Fujii,
                        are intercalated, and the faces of those two characters are the same. Thus, their lives might
                        not be easily well separated, even though the two storylines are intercalated. Moreover, there
                        is one more confusion in the settings of the movie. The two characters with the same name,
                        Itsuki Fujii. The name of Hiroko’s dead is Itsuki Fujii, and this name is shared by the other
                        female character. Those occasions interweaved to form a giant mystery that was slowly revealed
                        with the movie’s progress. To start from the beginning, the main character, widow Hiroko
                        Watanabe Watanabe mailed a letter to his dead husband’s hometown after she left his death
                        anniversary. She was simply wishing to have a closure to her past and to end her grief of her
                        dead husband, but accidentally she received a response. The message sent by Hiroko said
                        “How are you recently? I am actually still fine.” It was a letter doomed with no response.
                        However, she received the letter with the information: “I am fine, just with a light cold.”
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The stories of what happened after this simple response I wish to remain a secret to the readers.
                        The stories between the three characters are slowly revealing with the development of the movie.
                        The techniques of the entire plot was about two different women with the same look and the movie
                        from the beginning to the end was interspersed. It was a quite common technique used in novel
                        creations. The author might choose to use odd number chapters for one character’s stories, and
                        use even number characters for the other character’s stories. The timeline of each story is
                        followed chapter by chapter. Even though the protagonists are changed continuously, the story
                        still appears as a whole. In 1995, it was courageous for a director to use such montage for an
                        entire movie. From la grande syntagmatique (the large syntagmatic category) written by French
                        film theorist, Christian Metz, we can acknowledge that there are four different insert montage
                        techniques: l'insert subjectif, l'insert diegetique deplace, l'insert explicatif and l'insert
                        nondiegetique. Those could be roughly translated to subjective insertion, diegetic insertion,
                        explanatory insertion and non-relevant insertion. The technique adopted by Shinji Iwai would be
                        the second one. Iwai used two story sequences and each section in the sequence is continuous.
                        The purpose of this demonstration is to show that different events happen simultaneously. The
                        movies were full of occasions, but this intersection between two storylines cleverly eliminates
                        the abruptness of each unreasonable occasion.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/shunji/3.jpg" style="width:1080px"><br>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        With the occurrence of sending and receiving the letters, Hiroko would like to meet this mysterious
                        woman who has the same name as her husband. Although the scenes are picturing both women, the plot
                        and the structures of the movie cleverly avoid the encounter of the two women at the first half
                        of the movie. Hiroko went to the address printed on the letter of the response. It was certainly
                        now the female Itsuki Fujii’s house, and reasonably those two characters should meet with each
                        other. The director, however, would prefer more mystery in the plot and thus make the arrangement
                        that Itsuki Fujii will be at the hospital at the same time when Hiroko arrives at Fujii’s front gate.
                        Even though the two storylines changed continuously, those two characters just could not meet each
                        other directly. Just because of this impossibility, the audience would be always curious about what
                        would be on the next scene.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Besides the innovative structures of the movie, the scenes were also epic. To most of the audience,
                        the two most expressive scenes would be the two shots, one at the start and one at the end. At the
                        beginning of the movie, the protagonist Hiroko had just finished the death anniversary of her husband.
                        Hiroko was lying in the snow with reminiscence and sadness. The entire setting of that landscape with
                        the side portrait of the face of Hiroko was truly enchanting. After Hiroko climbed up from the snow,
                        and slowly walked down the mountain, Noboru Shinoda, the cinematographer of the movie, used a technique
                        called “spot moment”. Hiroko was wearing a black jacket walking in the giant white snow. She was tiny
                        in contrast to the entire widescreen of snow like a spot in the composition. Moreover, the black color
                        of her jacket has a more vibrant contrast to the bright white color of the snow. The scenes rendered a
                        feeling of yearn for the naturals, which revealed Hiroko’s wish to be relieved from her husband’s death
                        hidden deep in her heart.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/shunji/1.png" style="width:1080px"><br>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Another impressive scene would be the ending of the movie, when the myth of why Hiroko's dead husband
                        shares the same name with Itsuki Fujii is finally revealed. In the meantime, the love story embedded
                        in the time also unveils. I truly wish not to spoil the entire movie, and luckily the filming techniques
                        about that scenes were not absolutely worth analyzing. However,  there is indeed one more filming
                        technique that truly deserves to be discussed - the widescreen camera works, adopted by Noboru Shinoda.
                        In 1995, when the cinema did not completely accept widescreen work in Japan, Shinoda used his extraordinary
                        filming skills to accomplish the task. Thanks to human convention, the widescreen is more cinematic. The
                        obstacles were tremendous at that time, cameras, projectors and other filming equipment were used to have
                        the original ratio which is 4 to 3. However, for better visualization, Shinoda insisted to film the entire
                        movie by widescreen ratio.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The dialogues between Hiroko and one of her admirers, Akiba Shigera, were shot by the static cameras and also
                        motion cameras. The start of dialogue was quite peaceful, the cameras were static and then Shigera slowly
                        walked close to Hiroko and Hiroko intentionally to keep distance between her and Shigera. Those shots were
                        generally short and filmed by moving cameras. When both characters once stood still, the cameras switched to
                        static. Afterwards, Shigera suddenly approached Hiroko and tried to kiss her, the shots were moving. Once he
                        kissed her, the shots became static and a close-up to the lips. For the moving shots, the cinematographer did
                        not use any stabilizing equipment to make the scenes more smooth. However, the director merely required the
                        hand-hold camera to make the scenes look as natural as possible.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/shunji/2.jpg" style="width:1080px"><br>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        With many previous movies, I have analyzed different ways a director would choose to use when dealing
                        with the matter of death. In the movie, the funeral, the whole movie uses a documentary style to record
                        the entire process of the funeral, but generated a stronger impact on people facing the matter of death.
                        Without any exception, Iwai also used distinctive techniques for the filming of death. Different deaths
                        were across the entire movie. At the beginning, there was the death ceremony for Hiroko's husband. Moreover,
                        when Fujii’s cold got worse, she was taken to the emergency room. Fujii fell asleep in the waiting hall of
                        the hospital and she suddenly saw her father lying in the ICU. The focus was switching quickly, the shots
                        changed from clear to vague and changed from vague to clear. The death under these shots were in sorrow
                        rather than merely sadness.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/shunji/funeral.jpg" style="width:1080px"><br>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Despite the grand success of the ratings and bookings of the movie, Love letter is also a milestone
                        in Japanese movie history. After World War II, South Korea comprehensively prohibited the Japanese
                        media. However, this movie was released in South Korea and was uniformly applauded by the local
                        audience. The enormous cultural impact plays an important role in helping to break down the post-World
                        War II barrier between the two countries.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        At the present, the Last letter produced by Shinji Iwai, is still a drama and romance movie around
                        the information of letters. Even with the same genre as the Love letter, the new movie was still
                        applauded by the audience. The stories behind the letters are unique and the emotions written on
                        the papers are true without any exaggerations. The sentences used in the movie were simple and
                        concise: “ How are you recently?”, “I am fine.” However, behind the short and simple words are
                        the hidden emotions of deep affection and how heartly one misses another. Shinji Iwai could gently
                        express that warm feeling to the audience, with the not so unrealistic stories but the completely
                        true feelings. Twenty years after the release of Love Letter, people are still fond of this kind of
                        movie, because the emotions are permanent. Like Iwai wrote in his novel, “Even with the rush of
                        the time, the sincere emotions do not have changed. Life might be short and cursory, but Love is
                        ageless.” I believe that is what he tried to express in the Love Letter. After twenty years, what
                        he tries to express is still unchanged.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If the Love Letter is the beginning of the entire chapter, I assume the Last Letter would be the
                        last chapter of the era. I feel extremely fortunate to have the chance to witness the entire film
                        career of one remarkable director. Shinji Iwai said if there is one you could miss, that would be
                        happiness. For a movie enthusiast, there is always one movie directed by Shinji Iwai that I could
                        look forward to, I believe that would be my simplest happiness.
